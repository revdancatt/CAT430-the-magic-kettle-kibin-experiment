In Japan, high in the mountains, there lived an old man in his little house. He was very proud of his white straw mat and the neatly papered walls, and never tired of admiring them. He loved the warm weather and kept the windows to his garden open so that the smell of trees and flowers come in.

One day as he sat looking at the mountains when he heard a kind of the rumbling sound in the room behind him. He turned around. In a corner of the room he saw an old rusty iron kettle, which had not seen the light of day for many years. The old man had not known it was there, but he picked it up and looked it over carefully. He found that it was pretty so he cleaned off the dust and carried it to his kitchen.

"This is a godsend", he said smiling to himself. A good kettle costs money, and it is good to have a second one for an emergency. I get out, and carried the water starts coming through his already below." Then he took the other kettle from the fire, filled the new one with water, and put it on the fire.

No sooner was the water in the kettle warm than a strange thing happened that made the man think that he had been dreaming. First the handle of the kettle gradually changed its shape into a head and its spout grew into a tail coming out of a body which was four feet long, and in a few minutes the man found himself facing a tanuki! The creature jumped out of the fire, and scampered around the room like a kitten, ran up the walls up to the ceiling above, until the old man was in an agony over his pretty rooms being spolied. He shouted to a neighbor for help, and between them they managed to catch the tanuki, and shut him in a safe wooden chest. Then quite exhausted, they sat down on the matsto decide what to do with that pesky animal. Finally it was decided to sell it, and and requested a child to call a certain merchant named Jimmu.

When Jimmu arrived, the old man told him that there was something he wanted to sell, and lifted the lid of the wooden box where he had locked the tanuki, there was no tanuki, nothing but the kettle he had found in the corner. It was certainly very odd, but the man remembered what had happened over the fire. did not want to keep the kettle; so after a little haggling over the price, Jimmu went away carrying the kettle.

Now Jimmu had not gone far before he felt that the vessel was growing heavier and heavier, and when he got home, he was so tired that he was grateful to put it down in a corner of his room, and then forgot all about it. In the middle of the night he was awakened by a loud noise from the corner where the kettle stood. He sat up in bed to see what it was. But there was nothing except the kettle, which seemed to be quiet enough. He thought he must have dreamed, and went back to sleep, only to be awakened a second time by the same sound. He jumped out of bed and went to the corner, and by the light of the lamp that he always kept burning, he saw that the kettle had become a tanuki, the current round after his tail was. After he was tired, that he ran to the balcony, where he made several somersaults, from pure joy of the heart. The tradesman was much troubled as what to do with the animal, and it was only towards morning that he managed to sleep. But when he got up again there was no tanuki, only the old kettle that he had left the night before.

Once he cleaned up his house, Jimmu set out to tell his story, to a friend from next door. The man listened quietly and did not seem so surprised as Jimmu expected, because he remembered to have heard in his youth, about a wonder-working kettle. "Go and travel with him, and show them, he said, "And you'll become a rich man, but be careful to first ask the tanuki for permission, and also perform some magic ceremonies to prevent him from disappearing at the sight of the people."

Jimmu thanked his friend and followed the advice closely. The merchant obtained the tanuki's consent, built a stand and hung a notice inviting people to witness the most wonderful transformation ever seen.

They came in droves, and the kettle was passed from hand to hand, and they were allowed to examine it all over, and also to look inside. Then Jimmu took it back, and when he commanded it to become a tanuki. In an instant the handle began to change to a head, and the spout into a tail, while four legs appeared on the sides. 'Dance' said Jimmu, and the tanuki did his steps, and went first to one side and then on the other, until the people could not stop themselves any more and began to dance. The tanuki gracefully led the fan dance, and glided without a pause in the shadows dance and umbrella dance, and it seemed as if he could go on dancing forever. And so very likely he would, if Jimmu had not declared that he had had enough dancing and that the booth would be closed now.

Day after day, the stand was so crowded it was almost impossible to enter it, and what the neighbor had predicted, had come to pass, and Jimmu was a rich man. But he did not feel happy. He was an honest man, and he thought he owed some of the his fortune to the man of whom he had bought the kettle. So, one morning, he took a hundred pieces of gold and hanging the kettle once more on his arm, he returned it to the seller. "I have no right to keep it longer", he added, as he finished his story, "so I brought it back to you, and inside you will find a hundred pieces of gold as a reward for his rent."

The man thanked Jimmu, and said that few people would have behaved as honestly as he did. And the kettle brought them both luck and everything went well with them until they died when they were very old, and were respected by all.
