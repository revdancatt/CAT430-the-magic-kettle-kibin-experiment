High in the mountains of Japan, lived an old man. He was very proud of his white straw mat and the neatly papered walls. He never tired of admiring them. He loved the warm weather; and, kept the windows open. The old man loved to inhale the smell of the trees and flowers that came flowing in.

One day, he heard a kind of rumbling sound, in the room behind him. He turned around. In a corner of the room, he saw an old rusty iron kettle; which, had not seen, the light of day, for many years. The old man had not known it was there. He picked it up; and, looked it over carefully. He saw that it was pretty; so, he cleaned off the dust, and carried it to his kitchen.

"This is a godsend", he said, smiling to himself. A good kettle costs money; and, comes in handy for an emergency.

He took the other kettle from the fire; and, filled the new one with water, and put it on the fire.

Soon, the water in the kettle had warmed; and then a strange thing happened that caused the old man to believe he had been dreaming. The handle on the kettle had gradually changed its shape into that of a head; and, its spout grew into a tail, coming out of a body; which, was four feet long. A few minutes later, the old man found himself facing a tanuki. The creature jumped out of the fire; and, scampered around the room like a kitten. Up the walls to the ceiling; until the old man was in agony over his pretty rooms being spoiled. He shouted to a neighbor for help; and, between them managed to catch the tanuki. They shut him in a safe wooden chest. Then exhausted, they sat down on the matsto; to, decide what to do with that pesky animal. Finally they decided to sell it. The old man and his neighbor asked a child to call a merchant whose name was Jimmu.

After Jimmu arrived, the old man told him he had something he wanted to sell. As he lifted the lid of the wooden box where he had locked the tanuki, there was no tanuki. Only the kettle he had found in the corner. It was  odd; but, the old man remembered what had happened; and, did not want to keep the kettle. After haggling over the price, Jimmu went away carrying the kettle.

Jimmu had not gone far; before, he felt the vessel growing heavier when he got home, he was tired that he forgot all the kettle. During the night, he was awakened by a loud noise from the room where the kettle was sitting. He sat up in bed when he heard the noise. There was nothing except the kettle; which, seemed to be quiet. He thought he must have been dreaming; and went back to sleep. He was awakened a second time by the same sound. He jumped out of bed and tiptoed to the corner; and, using the lamp he kept burning; and, he saw that the kettle had become a tanuki. After he was rested, he ran to the balcony; where, he made several somersaults, from the joy of his heart. The tradesman was troubled as what to do with the animal; and, it morning, when he managed to finally sleep. When he had reawakened there was no tanuki; but, only the old kettle that he had left the night before.

Once he cleaned up his house, Jimmu set out to tell his story to a friend from next door. The man listened quietly; and, did not seem surprised as Jimmu expected. He  remembered that he had heard about a wonder-working kettle. "Go and travel with him, and show them," he said, "And you'll become a rich man; but, ask the tanuki for permission; and, perform some magic to prevent him from disappearing."

Jimmu thanked his friend; and, followed the advice closely. Jimmu obtained the tanuki's consent; and, built a stand and hung a notice inviting people to witness the most wonderful transformation ever seen.

They came in droves; and, the kettle was passed from hand to hand. People were allowed to examine it all over; and, also to look inside. Then Jimmu took it back; and, commanded it to become a tanuki. In an instant, the handle began to change to a head; and, the spout changed into a tail. Four legs appeared on the sides. "Dance", said Jimmu. The tanuki did his steps, first to one side and then the other; until, the people could not stop themselves any more, and began to dance. The tanuki gracefully led the fan dance; and, glided; in the shadows dance, and umbrella dance. It seemed as though, he could go on dancing forever. He would; but, Jimmu had not declared he had, had enough dancing; and, the booth would be closed.

Day after day, the stand was so crowded, it was almost impossible to enter it. What the neighbor predicted, had come to pass; and, Jimmu was a rich man. But he did not feel happy. He was an honest man; and, he thought he owed some of his fortune, to the man had purchased the kettle. One morning, he took a hundred pieces of gold; and, hanging the kettle once more on his arm, he returned it to the seller. "I have no right to keep it longer", he added, as he finished his story, "so I brought it back to you, and inside you will find a hundred pieces of gold as a reward for his rent."

The man thanked Jimmu; and, told the man few people would have behaved as honestly, as he did. The kettle brought them both luck; and, everything went well with them; until, they died, and were respected by all.
