The Magic Kettle Experiment
===========================

This is an experiment with Chinese Whispers. I want to see what happens if I take an old story, in this case The Magic Kettle from Andrew Lang's Crimson Fairy Book (http://www.mythfolklore.net/andrewlang/222.htm) and ask for it to be proofread and edited by the people over at Kibin.com (http://kibin.com).

I'm wondering if the story will move away from its original source much like chinese whispers (or photocopying something and photocopying the result again and again). Or if the editors & proofreaders will reach a consensus that the story has been edited and proofread to perfection and no further edits or improvements can be made.

I can only submit the story to Kibin once every 24 hours and sometimes I'll be submitting blog posts that I actually need to get edited myself, so I'll be skipping some days. Each time I submit it I'll apply *all* the recommended changes and then put the new version back into Kibin to be proofread and edited again.

Oh also, to get the ball rolling and to seed the editing process I translated the original into German and then back into English using Google Translate, just to give people something to work with :)

And then of course post the new versions here.

Here we go:
